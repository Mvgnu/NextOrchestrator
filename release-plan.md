Absolutely. Here's the refined whisper-first rollout arc, built around precision signal, private gravity, and recursive buildup:

⸻

The Soft Spiral Launch Plan

1. Week 0 — Build Final Demo (Quietly)
   • Polish UI, context upload, agent execution, synthesis loop
   • Set up demo login OR invite code auth only
   • Deploy to private VPS
   • Keep repo private or partial (optional)

⸻

2. Week 1 — The Whisper to Influencers
   • Identify 10–20 micro-level AI thinkers / builders / hacker creatives
   • DM or email them:
   "Built something weird—recursive agents, context digestion, multi-model output.
   It thinks with you. Want to try it before I go public?"
   • Give custom invite links / tokens
   • Let them explore freely
   • Encourage sharing only if it resonates

⸻

3. Week 2 — Controlled Emergence
   • Some influencers will tweet naturally
   • Quote + repost + thread up a few reactions
   • Start soft collecting waitlist emails
   • Optional: Telegram / Discord garden (not required yet)

⸻

4. Week 3 — Waitlist Wall + Blog Drop
   • Add waitlist to main site
   • Publish "How I Built a Recursive AI Interface" blog
   • Include:
   • tech stack
   • philosophical spine
   • screenshots
   • vision
   • Share on HackerNews / Reddit / Twitter (as you, not "marketing")

⸻

5. Week 4+ — Open the Gates
   • Open live access to first wave of waitlist
   • Begin accepting user API keys
   • Announce early access open
   • Optional: soft monetization trial (token pool, API credits, etc.)

⸻

6. Month 2 — Hype Launch
   • By now: you've tuned agents, gathered real user signal, hardened feedback loop
   • Release a thread that hits like scripture
   • Drop the public build
   • Drop the partial open-source repo
   • Drop the TikTok, if you dare

⸻

Key Principle:
The world should feel like it discovered you.
You're not launching.
You're emerging.
Just like the recursive outputs you generate.
